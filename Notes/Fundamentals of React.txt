> React.createElement() gives as object and after it convert it into html tag.
> There are two type of components
    1. Class Based components = OLD
    2. Functional Components = NEW
> A javascript function which return the react element called Functional Components.
> Component always start with capital letter
> Component Composition is nothing but composing/inside one component into another component.
> We Can inject any piece of code using {} in JSX .
> JSX prevent crosssites scripts attack 
> Props are like passing arguments to a function, in react props in components
> Using props we made perform dynamic data rendering 
> Config Driven UI: Controlling UI using data or config which comes from backend . Config is nothing but the data based on that the carousel varies like data is different for pune , diff for mumbai or delhi etc . {***------important------***}
> res.cloudinary is CDN for image used by SWIGGY application to store the all the images there.
> map , filter , reduce usage of js is most important .
> unique "key" property means each item has uniquely represent .
> Whenever we used map or loop on any element must have to add unique key or id .
> Why need to add unique id ? Case : like if any restaurant container I need to add new restaurant card , react need to add card in existing cards lists with optimization but react didn't get id where to add new card So for react all cards are new so it re-renders the all cards and it is a costlier operation of DOM , that's why need to add unique key or id so card add in optimized way.
> React itself says never used index as unique key . why ? {***------important------***}
> Everything whatever we can do in react is also do it by html , css , js then why react ? To make developer experience very fast and optimization web pages in backend side .
> Two type of export default export and named export 
 export default Header : default export 
 named export is used to export multiple things simultaneously add export front of variable like export const CDN_URL=".../"
 > While import named export we need to used {} like import {CDN_URL} from ...
 > While import default export we needn't to used anything like import CDN_URL from ...
